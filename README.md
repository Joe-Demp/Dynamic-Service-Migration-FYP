# Dynamic Service Migration for Edge-Cloud Applications Codebase

The applications in each of the child repositories were built with Apache Maven 3.6.3 and Java version 13.0.1. The `console-app` project depends on the `Core` module in `mec-framework`. Therefore, it is suggested to first build `mec-framework/Core` before anything else.

Each of the child repositories has a README to explain how to build and run the applications.
